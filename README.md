# Flappy Bird Genetic Evolution
This project aims to train an agent in the PyGame environment "Flappy Bird". The training process uses a combination of Neural Network algorithms and Genetic algorithms.

## Algorithm Process
* Each generation contains 50 birds
* At each generation, the breeding process is performed based on fitness scores
* Crossover swaps the first layers of the NN of the selected parents
* Finally, random mutations are performed in order to achieve diversity
